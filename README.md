## Description

**TravelMap** is an app using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack, this was made to learn better react, the channel used as a base to this development was [Lama Dev](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOxWrX5MIdXIeRNaXC3sqIg).


## How to use
Firstly you should add the values on .env.example and change to .env:
* In the frontend folder:

  `REACT_APP_MAPBOX = ` MAPBOX public key

* In the backend folder:

  `MONGO_URL = ` URL of a mongodb connection, with username and passowrd

After the other steps, you'll need to use `npm install` and `npm start` inside the backend and the frontend folders.
